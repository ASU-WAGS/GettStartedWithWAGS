Start Guide

Student Registration:

In order to register students to your section, please click the "Admin Panel" button. On the left side of the page, click the "Student Management". You'll see three headings: "Register Students", "Password Reset", and "Student Review". Under the "Register Student" heading, click the "Choose File" button and search for the CSV file that is the list of your students. The file must be in the format: 

Smith	Joe	        jsmith@school.edu
Scott	Micheal	mscott@theoffice.com

Once you select your file, simply click the "Register" button and your students will automatically be added to your section. They will all have the default password "password". 

Assign Magnet / Logical Problems:

Starting at the initial splash screen (click the WAGS logo in the top left to get here), click the "Admin Panel" button. Once on this page, click either the "Logical Problem Management" or "Magnet Problem Management" to assign problems. Use the buttons to narrow down the specific problem you want to assign. For example: 

Binary Trees -> Traversals -> BST Preorder Traversal

Once you find the problems you want to assign, click the check-box next to them. Once you have all the problems you want to assign, simply click "Add to Assigned" under the "SELECTED" box on the right. 

Solving Assigned Problems

Again, starting at the initial splash screen (click the WAGS logo in the top left to get here), click either the "Logical Microlabs" or "Magnet Microlabs", depending on which you assigned to your students. You'll see the list of problems you have assigned on the left side of the screen. 

Magnet Problems: When you click on a magnet microlab, you'll see a panel with two sides. The left side will give you a list of different pieces of code and the right side of the screen will be the class in which you need to place the magnets. Once you've placed the magnets in the correct order, just click the "Finalize" button on the bottom of the right panel. This will navigate you to the Results panel where you will see the output of your code. If you didn't get the problem correct, you can simply click the "Editing Mode" button on the top left and retry the problem. 

Logical Problems: When you click on a logical microlab, you'll see only one panel. Depending on the problem type, the students will be asked to do different things. For example: click nodes in a tree in the correct preorder traversal, click the edges in the correct kruskals order, and so on. Once you've completed the task, click the "Evaluate" button just above the problem. Once clicked, you'll see your results in a small popup window. 

Student Review:

Once problems have been assigned to your students, you can watch their progress by navigating the "Student Management" section of the Admin Panel. To navigate to this panel, click the "WAGS" logo in the top left, then select the "Admin Panel" button, and lastly click the "Student Management" button on the bottom left of the screen. Under the "Student Review" heading, you'll see a list of your students. You can click each individual name and see their number of attempts on each problem, as well as if they got the problem correct.
